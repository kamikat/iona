# Getting Started

In this guide, we'll learn basics in creating a documentation site with <Link to="./Introduction.mdx">Iona</Link>.

## Step 1: Setup a New Project

Let's get started with creating a new React project or skip to next step if you already have one.

Iona projects are basically React projects. So any React toolchain setup should just work for Iona.

For the best, we use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/):

```bash
npx create-react-app fancy-docs
```

Feel free to do any customization on the new project and run `yarn start` to see your app.

## Step 2: Add the Package

For our **fancy-docs** which is a standalone documentation project, Iona can be installed as a dependency:

```bash
yarn add iona-doc
```

_(There's another guide on a compact project structure for React component libraries)_

Edit `App.js` to include something like:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Iona from 'iona-doc';
import Page from 'iona-doc/Page.macro';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Iona name="fancy-docs" version="0.1.0">
      <Page src="./docs/Introduction.mdx" />
    </Iona>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Note that the `<Page src="..." />` element declares a page that does not yet been created.

And here we'll see an error message:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve './docs/Introduction.mdx' in ...
```

## Step 3: Edit Page

It's time to create our first page for **fancy-docs**.

Iona uses an extended markdown syntax. But for now, just add some markdown stuff on the page.

Edit `docs/Introduction.mdx` with something like:

```
# Introduction

Cheers! My first fancy Iona page written in basic **Markdown** syntax.

| ID | Name               | Rank              |
|----|--------------------|-------------------|
| 1  | Tom Preston-Werner | Awesome           |
| 2  | Albert Einstein    | Nearly as awesome |
```

Congratulations! You have now completed your first page on Iona.

Save and visit the page at <http://localhost:3000/>

## What's Next

Now you are ready to create a simple document set with basic markdown syntax.

The <Link to="./WritingMDX.mdx">next section</Link> we'll introduce the basics of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
as well as some useful features and techniques to create interactive pages with React components:

- Use React component in MDX
- The YAML front matters
- Cross-reference
- Editor support

Another guide of <Link to="./CreateTOC.mdx">navigation system</Link> will get your ready to
manage a moderate document project efficiently.

Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/kamikat/iona/issues) if there's any question or some advice on the library.

All kinds of contributions are appreciated.
